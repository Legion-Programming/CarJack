# CarJack
Carjack is a car wishlist application that gives you a projected total cost and an estimate on payments. You put in your typical driving behavior, then chose the car you want and then you can select to check if it is compatible with your driving needs. From there you can get an estimate on payments and save the car to your "Garage" to view later.

This project served as a means to demonstrate an application that could be used in an industry setting in accordance to our class project. 
If paired with (a) vehicle database(s) from dealers and manufacturers, then this app could serve as a baseline for a dealership app that utilizes their vehicle database to have an interactive experience for the customer. With database integration it should be easy to get real vehicle prices, updated selection, and realistic insight into compatibility and payment estimator.
